    * @brief A scene to contain all entities and to load and unload required
    *        assets appropriately for the ones that are referenced
    *
    * Switching scenes should guarantee a full clean up of the previous scene,
    * this way scenes can be used to switch between menus, levels, etc. in an
    * isolated environment.
    *
    * Persistent data can easily be done through the power of scripting, which
    * the user can then define the behavior of themselves.
    *
    * For the user to not have to explicitly add entities to the scene
    * themselves, the scenes are statically available through the SceneService
    * living in the Application.
