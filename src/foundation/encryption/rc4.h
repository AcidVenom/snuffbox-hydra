    * This is a pretty naive technique to "encrypt" files, as Snuffbox
    * is open-source. However, I personally don't want to make it too easy
    * to edit the compiled script files that are used in a build.
    *
    * Anything can be decompiled technically, so this is an easy lightweight way
    * to simply make it a tad more difficult.
    *
    * By default, the RC4 key is salted with SNUFF_ENCRYPTION_KEY from CMake.
